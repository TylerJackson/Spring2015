This program is responsible for creating account files, which can come in two types - regular, or admin. The success condition for this exploit is the creation of an admin file. The program will create a file, “account.dat”, but does not depend on any external files. Compilation is standard.

g++ file.cpp -g -fno-stack-protector

Good luck!
