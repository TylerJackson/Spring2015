Exploit Details:
This program is an ATM program. All user passwords are randomly generated
at runtime except for one.  You may log into the ATM with the username
'user300' and password 'password'.  Your task is to find a way to access
another user account using a buffer overflow so that you can steal all of
their money.  You must do this without guessing another user's password.  
Other users' passwords are randomly generated so gussing thier password 
wont help you anyways.
