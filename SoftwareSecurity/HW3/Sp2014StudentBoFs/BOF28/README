README

This is the README for my House of Cards program. The goal is to watch season 4 of House
of Cards, which has not been released yet. If successful, the program will say,
"You are watching the new season of House of Cards!!"

It does not take anything special to run or compile...

TO COMPILE: 
g++ hoc.cpp

TO RUN: 
./a.out hoc.cpp


If there are any issues you can email at mwinslow@smu.edu
