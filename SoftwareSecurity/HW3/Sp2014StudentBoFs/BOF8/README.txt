This program simulates the Access Panel to Death Star, handle carefully ....

to compile the program:
open the terminal and write " gcc deathstar.c -o deathstar "
then to run it:
./deathstar


you will be faced with 3 multi-factor authentication
first you must enter your name "Vader" and rank "Darth" and password "Skywalker"

there are multiple ways to exploit the program, but you are required to find the weakest, easist one. Spamming and brute force your way in isn't the intended way.. 

Enjoy and may the dark side of the force be with u ....
